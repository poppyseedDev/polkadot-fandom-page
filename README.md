# Kodadot Fandom Shop

Built with Next js, powered by [Uniquery](https://github.com/kodadot/uniquery).

This app was built for showcasing [Uniquery](https://github.com/kodadot/uniquery), KodaDot's GraphQL API, for querying data from the blockchain. It's a simple shop that uses Uniquery to fetch NFTs from the blockchain via the [SubSquid indexer](http://subsquid.io).
